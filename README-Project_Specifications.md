My Python OOP Project for "COS340a - Programming in Python" Class

Detailed Description:
The  Class  Project  assignment  for  the  COS  340  course  is  an  individual  work.  
Every  student  has  to  develop independently a substantial program, using the Python programming. 
Every student is responsible to propose the topic (problem) of the project and to seek approval by the instructor by the end of the seventh week of the semester. 
A project needs to have all of the following required properties:
- Uses at least three classes exploring inheritance or composition – stored in a separate file then the main function/program.
- The program should have functionality that reads from/writes to a file – the files can be either text files or csv files.
- The name of the file and/or other important input should not be hard-coded, but passed as a parameter to the python script.
- The project should include some manipulation of the data - filtering, sorting, mapping, aggregation, etc.
- Unit tests should be included, covering at least 50% of the code.
- The project should include at least 100 lines of code (without the unit tests).
- All of the project files should abide the pep8 rules.

The documentation/specification of the project must be uploaded on Canvas by the specified deadline and should contain:
- Short (one or two paragraph) description of the problem;
- Class structure and description;
- Description of special functions and/or algorithms used;
- Instructions how to start and work with the program.
